                <h1>Potato</h1>
                <p>The potato is a starchy food native to the Americas and is a perennial in the nightshade family Solanaceae. It was originally believed to have been domesticated by Native Americans in multiple locations, but genetic studies traced a single origin to present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia. It was introduced to Europe by the Spanish in the 16th century and is now a staple food in many parts of the world. It contains the toxin solanine, which is dangerous for human consumption. Green sections of the plant can accumulate a high concentration of glycoalkaloids, which can affect human health.</p>
